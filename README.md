The Student Record Management System is a web-based application that allows users to add, store, and display student records. This project combines C language with WebAssembly (WASM) for high-performance computations and uses Flask to serve the web interface. Users can input student details such as Roll Number, Name, and Marks, which are processed using a WebAssembly module compiled from C.

The application provides a user-friendly interface, handles data securely, and displays the stored records dynamically. The project demonstrates the seamless integration of low-level C with modern web technologies, enhancing both speed and functionality.
